Football World Cup live score

Assumptions:
- Home and away matchups have already been determined, so they have been saved in their own maps.
- When the scores are updated, the home and away scores are incremented by random numbers. Scores don't have an upper limit, so they increase as long as the Update Scores button is pressed, and stops only when the Finish Game is pressed.
- Live updates of games will stop if all games have been finished.
